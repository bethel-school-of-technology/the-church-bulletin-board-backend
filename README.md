# the-church-bulletin-board-backend
20191005 - This branch is basically our 'master' branch for the backend, however it has the 'master-dev' title since there was some question as to the roles of sending data to the true 'master' master branch.  We were unsure as to whether or not our instructor merged the files to the master or we (as students) merge the dev to the master.  So have a 'master-dev' that would serve as a go-between.
